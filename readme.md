## Video Tutorial

I also created a video course where you can learn everything from creating a character in Photoshop, to the whole process of animating the character to finally incorporating the animation in your Corona Project, you can find the video tutorials here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FGhJ6gRl4Q&list=PLKhvt82d5sfCE6KkM1V6Bs46GG4HOguP1

## Special Thanks

This module wouldn't have been possible witout the creation of the "matrix.lua" library (LuaMatrix) by Michael Lutz (chillcode) - original author and David Manura (maintener) https://github.com/davidm/lua-matrix

I hope you create great games with this module. Should you have any questions please contact me via Twitter @coronadevs
